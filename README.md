## 🎨 Typography & Custom Font Drop-In

As specified, a **custom display font** for main headings can be dropped in easily:

1. Place your font file in:
   ```
   public/fonts/hackfest-custom-heading.woff2
   ```
2. Open [`src/index.css`](file:///c:/Users/itsak/OneDrive/Desktop/SDC/Hackfest%203.0%20Website/Hackfest3.0/src/index.css) and uncomment the `@font-face` block:
   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: 'HackfestCustomFont';
     src: url('/fonts/hackfest-custom-heading.woff2') format('woff2');
     font-weight: 700 900;
     font-display: swap;
   }
   ```
3. The custom font is scoped strictly to display headlines, arena titles, and hero statements (`.heading-display` & `.heading-section`). Body text remains clean, highly readable neutral sans-serif (`Plus Jakarta Sans`), and metadata uses monospace (`JetBrains Mono`).

## ⚙️ Configuration Architecture

All event details, timings, problem categories, and judging rubrics are centralized in:
[`src/data/eventData.js`](file:///c:/Users/itsak/OneDrive/Desktop/SDC/Hackfest%203.0%20Website/Hackfest3.0/src/data/eventData.js)

To update event dates, venue details, or finalize `[TO BE DECIDED]` times, simply edit this file without modifying component logic.
